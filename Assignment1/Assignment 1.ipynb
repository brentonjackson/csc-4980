    "\n",
    "In the previous example, we learned that camera calibration required a few things:\n",
    "- **Extrinsic parameters** of the camera, e.g. rotation and translation vectors, which translates a coordinate of a 3D point to a coordinate system\n",
    "- **Intrinsic parameters** of the camera, e.g. focal length and optical centers (both given in the form of a camera matrix) - visit [this link](https://ksimek.github.io/2013/08/13/intrinsic/) for a great breakdown on the intrinsic params\n",

    "\n",
    "We used images of a chess board to find the camera matrix values since we knew the relative positions of the square corners on the board. By doing this, we were able to find intrinsic parameters of the OAK-D Lite camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use those parameters (e.g. focal point and optical centers) to undistort any image taken with the camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "As will be explained in a second, we can also use one of the parameters to help us find real world coordinates of our object from 2d image coordinates. That's the goal of using perspective projection equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use of Perspective Projection Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The general play-by-play of part B will be to:\n",
    "1. Undistort our image\n",
    "2. Find some desired dimension in our 2D image, like height or width\n",
    "3. Use perspective projection equations to convert our desired dimension to 3D, real world values and units\n",
    "\n",
    "We know how to do 1. We've already done it, so we can modify our camera calibration script from Part A to accept any image, undistort it, then write that new image to the disk for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 2, we can go about it in two ways:\n",
    "1. Calculate the 2D dimensions of the object(s) in our image using object outlines, bounding boxes, and calculated Euclidean distances of those bounding box sides\n",
    "2. Allow the user to specify two points of interest and use those points to calculate the 2D dimensions of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "I will opt for method 2, since it's very easy to test in the real-world.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 3, this is where we actually make use of the equations which I will go over in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perspective Projection Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The perspective projection equations are equations that allow us to convert coordinates on the image plane to coordinates in the real world, and vice-versa. It uses the concept of similar triangles to essentially create a ratio. It's better explained with an image:\n",

    "\n",
    "From these equations, we can see that **a point in the real world depends on the ratio of the object distance from the camera to the focal length, times the corresponding coordinate on the image plane**. Since we know the 2D image coordinates and the focal length of the camera, which we got from our camera matrix, we only need to know the distance of the object from the camera.\n",
