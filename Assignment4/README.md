# Assignment 1

## Submission in Classroom:

**_Submission: [Here](https://github.com/brentonjackson/csc-4980/blob/master/Assignment4/Assignment%204.ipynb)_**

**_Demo:_**

Camera images of paper worksheets will NOT be accepted

- **Python:** submit a jupyter notebook and the .py files associated

- Manage all your code in a github repo for each assignment.

- Provide a link to the repo in the documentation workspace
  (jupyter notebook or mlx file).

- Create a working demonstration of your application and record a screen-recording or a properly captured footage of the working system.
- Upload the video in the Google classroom submission.

**Hardware**: Unless otherwise specified, CAMERA refers to the OAK-D Lite camera provided to you.

**Software**:
For OAK-D you can implement your solutions in either Python or
C/C++: https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/

Also submit a properly edited video of the demonstration of the applications.
The video can be up to 2min long each. It has to have professional quality. Raw handheld footage with some broken
audio overlay will not be considered.

**NOTE:**
Each team must come up with 3 different ways to solve the problem and must implement them.
Each person will implement one. The number of ways is commensurate with the team size. If
there are only 2 or you are alone then it is 2 and 1 respectively.
All three techniques must work for the team’s submission to be considered. So make sure you
work closely with your teammates.
All participants of the team MUST submit the files via classroom.

## Part I

1. Implement an application using the stereo camera where it will recognize, track and
   estimate dimensions of an object within 3m distance and inside field-of-view to the
   camera. You can use barcodes or text recognition tools for identification. However, the
   entire object must be tracked (not just the barcode or text). Machine/Deep learning tools
   are allowed. Demonstrate it to work for one object at least. It can be a 2D object.

## Part II

2. Design an eco-friendly (try your best: as reusable as possible) “smart” business/visiting
   card (actual hardware) and an associated computer vision application using the camera
   provided. You can leverage depth information in your design.
